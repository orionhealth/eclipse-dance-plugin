# eclipse-dance-plugin

If you have ever developed an OSGi plugin you may be familiar with the Eclipse Dance:
Reload target platform, refresh projects, clean all projects, on run configuration add all bundles from target platform & sometimes delete the work directory.
This plugin replaces all of that with a shiny button (code coming shortly).

All items can be enabled or disabled.
