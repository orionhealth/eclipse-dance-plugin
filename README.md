# eclipse-dance-plugin

If you have ever developed an OSGi plugin you may be familiar with the Eclipse Dance:

* Reload target platform
* Refresh projects
* Clean all projects
* Add all bundles from target platform into Run/Debug Configuration
* And sometimes, delete the work directory!

This plugin replaces all of that with a shiny button (code coming shortly).

All items can be enabled or disabled.
