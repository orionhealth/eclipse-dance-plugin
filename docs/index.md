## Eclipse Dance Plugin

If you have ever developed an OSGi plugin you may be familiar with the Eclipse Dance:

Reload target platform
Refresh projects
Clean all projects
Add all bundles from target platform into Run/Debug Configuration
And sometimes, delete the work directory!
This plugin replaces all of that with a shiny button.

All items can be enabled or disabled.

### Installation
In Eclipse, Help > Install New Software. Click Add.
In the Location field, enter https://orionhealth.github.io/eclipse-dance-plugin/update-site
